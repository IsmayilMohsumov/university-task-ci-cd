Remarks for implementation:

- handle negative scenarios, e.g. no user found when attempting to update the user
- add logging
- try to follow single responsibility principle
- add some unit tests coverage where you see it makes sense
- follow MVC layered architecture
- use DTOs to communicate between layers
- frontend doesn't have to be great
- use hibernate/jpa to communicate with DB
